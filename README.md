# libft
### This project is part of 42 cursus.
It consists in recreating some libc functions, some own functions and compiling it to a static lib (libft.a) to use during the cursus (since we cannot use basically any libs).
It is a simple project, as it is the first, only needs basic C and programming logic understanding.
